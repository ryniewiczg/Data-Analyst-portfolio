     - `Avg Profit = AVERAGE(Profit)`
     - `Total Sales = SUM(Sales)`
     - `Total Profit = SUM(Profit)`

2. **Data Modeling**
   - Verified relationships and data types
   - Ensured time intelligence with proper Date hierarchy

3. **Dashboard Design**
   - KPI Cards: Total Sales, Total Profit, Orders Count, Avg Profit
