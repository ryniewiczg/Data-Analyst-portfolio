This project is an Excel-based Bike Sales Dashboard, which I built to analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
The goal was to understand what factors influence bike purchases and to create an interactive dashboard that supports quick, data-driven decision-making.

During this project, I cleaned the dataset, performed analysis using Pivot Tables, and designed a fully interactive dashboard, demonstrating practical skills in Excel for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence.


Project Objectives

In this project, I aimed to:

- analyze factors that influence whether a customer buys a bike,
